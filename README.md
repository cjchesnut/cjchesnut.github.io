This webpage is still a work in progress, so don't be surprised if you visit and see something that was meant for testing! 
However I do my best to limit any testing on the live site.
The site currently is only HTML. Once I've gotten gotten comfortable with plain HTML I'll move on towards CSS and JavaScript for
useabililty and functionality.
