        <p>Personal Website</p>
            <ul><li>My goal for this website is to make it as interesting as a static website can be, while building good foundations in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</br>
                I'm still a complete beginner, so just about everything will be static HTML.</li></ul>
        <p>Gudako Bot</p>
            <ul><li>Gudako Bot is a discord bot that allows for simulating gacha pulls in Discord text chat. It's currently on hold.</li></ul>
